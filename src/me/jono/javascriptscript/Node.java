 * To understand what a Node is, let me explain how the language JavaScriptScript++#--.jssppsmm works. If you've ever
 * seen graph theory or a circuit diagram or the stuff in Blender, it's basically just that. There are Nodes and
 * connections between the Nodes. Each node does a simple little thing, like add some of its properties together or
 * display text. The nodes come together to make cool programs. In theory, this is a cool visual way of doing code, but
 * in practice, things can get... messy... This is why I made JavaScriptScript++#--.jssppsmm this sort of visual
 * language. The language is a joke that I want to be completely usable, but also just a mess. Then again, this is my
 * second crack at making this. I erased my old code to make stuff work better. So I guess it's just a little
 * serious for me.
